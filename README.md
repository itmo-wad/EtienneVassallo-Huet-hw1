## Configuration part
1. During this first work I first spent a lot of time configurating everything like gitHub and Visual studio
2. I also spent a lot of time understanding how things work ⏳

## Frontend: html, css
1. Then, I tried to learn again how html/css worked (I forgot a lot since the last time I used this language) in order to create a CV page.
2. I created an html/css profil page that looks like a CV

## Backend
1. After that, I learned how flask worked in order to Serve static profile page at default route (‘/’)
2. The profile page is running on  Running on **http://127.0.0.1:5000/** 💻

## What I learned
1. Even if the task was basic I learned a lot about how all the **different tools work together** 🖥
2. I also learned more about the language **html/css** and about **flask**
3. Finally, I also learned that when I upload a file on github, I shouldn't put a venv file in it...🙄 as it didn't work and took me 
a lot of time (and also the teachers time) to understand were the mistake came from
